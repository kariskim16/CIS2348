'''
You will design a program that manages the inventory of an electronics store. You will need to use a number of concepts that you learned in class including: use of classes, use of dictionaries and input and output of comma delimeted csv files.

Input:
    a) ManufacturerList.csv -- contains items listed by row. Each row contains item ID, manufacturer name,2 item type, and optionally a damaged indicator
    b) PriceList.csv -- contains items listed by row. Each row contains item ID and the item price.
    c) ServiceDatesList.csv â€“ contains items listed by row. Each row contains item ID and service date.

Example ManufacturerList.csv, PriceList.csv and ServiceDatesList.csv are provided for reference. Your code will be expected to work with any group input files of the appropriate format. Manufacturers can and will likely be different as will the items.

You can reuse parts of your code from Part 1.

Required Output:

1) Interactive Inventory Query Capability

a. Query the user of an item by asking for manufacturer and item type with a single query.
